Indexed  View  vs Standard View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Indexed View: Automatically updates when the underlying table is modified.
Standard View: Always reflects the latest data since it’s a query, not stored data.


Views in SQL Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Standard Views:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-->If the view is a standard view (not indexed), it doesn’t store data and simply re-executes the query each time it’s accessed. 
--> Thus, it will always reflect the latest data from the underlying tables without needing "updates."

Indexed View:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
-->  Automatically maintained by SQL Server.
--> Requires Enterprise Edition for full performance benefits.
--> Strict requirements on the view definition.
--> Ideal for scenarios where you need real-time, synchronized data with minimal maintenance.
