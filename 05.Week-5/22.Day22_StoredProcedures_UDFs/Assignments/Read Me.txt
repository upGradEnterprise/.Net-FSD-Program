Additional Context

Database Schema: The solutions assume a SQL Server database (UniversityDB) with tables:

Students (StudentID, FirstName, LastName).
Courses (CourseID, CourseCode, CourseName, CreditHours, MaxCapacity, PrerequisiteCourseID).
StudentCourses (StudentID, CourseID, EnrollmentDate, Grade, Status).


Objectives: The solutions aim to improve efficiency, reduce errors, ensure data consistency, and enhance scalability in the universityâ€™s database operations.

Constraints: The solutions must operate within the SQL Server environment, handle concurrent access, and adhere to university policies (e.g., grade scales, enrollment rules).
