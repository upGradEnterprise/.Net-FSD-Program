To Access metadata about the file system items:  
	a. FileInfo
	b. DirectoryInfo


To process the content of the file:
		a.  File
		b.  Stream Classes 

Namespace :   System.IO




StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(fileName, isAppend);
sw.WriteLine();
sw.Close();


[OR]

using(  StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(fileName, isAppend) )
{
	sw.WriteLine();
}

 






Task:   Writing List employee data in text file as CSV format


class  Employee{ ...  }   // override ToString()

List<Employee>  empList = new List<Employee> {......};


StreamWriter sw = new StreamWriter(...);

foreach(var item in  empList    )
{
			sw.WriteLine(item);
}
